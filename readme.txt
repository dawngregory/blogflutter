== Frequently Asked Questions == 
= How does the plugin connect with my Twitter account? =
You have to register with Twitter to obtain a set of access keys. 
When you install these keys in the plugin, you activate the connection to Twitter.

If you ever suspect your account is breached, simply change the access keys via Twitter.

= WTF is a Magic Hashtag? =
Magic hashtags let one hashtag take the place of many. For example, anything
I tag with #marketing could also be tagged with #contentmarketing or many other options.

By defining the options in one place, I can use #marketing to stand for all of them.
